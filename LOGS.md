### DEV. LOG

**June, 25, 2025** <br> Created login/register pages along with their functionality. Also updated the Todo to be associated for each User and added the JWT authentication for retrieving, creating, updating and deleting todo list. <br> Noticed that the codebase is starting to get messy, will have to research on how to keep things organized. <br> The CSS is also getting messy, sooo will be switching to TailwindCSS first before adding the rest of the features, this should help with the responsiveness and the uniform look of the app, hopefully... ðŸ¥²ðŸ˜†
